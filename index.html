                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As a 4th-year MPhys student at Durham University, my journey in physics and astronomy is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the universe. I'm deeply passionate about unraveling the fundamental forces and phenomena that shape our cosmos, from the intricate processes of galaxy formation to the enigmatic nature of dark matter and dark energy. I am eager to continue my work in astrophysics, with a strong interest in projects that effectively combine theoretical models with observational data to reveal deeper insights into the universe's fundamental mysteries.</p>

                <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                <p>My research interests centers on the study of dark matter and the large-scale structure of the universe, with a focus on the integration of cosmological N-body simulations. Through my current work, I aim to enhance resolution limits by populating lower-mass dark matter subhaloes, providing critical insights into gamma-ray annihilation predictions and galactic structure formation. Moving forward, I am keen to incorporate hydrodynamical simulations to explore the baryonic effects on galaxy evolution in both cold and warm dark matter scenarios, which would allow a more complete analysis of ultra-diffuse galaxy formation and morphology. Additionally, I am eager to employ machine learning methods to handle complex astrophysical data, leveraging its potential for more efficient analysis and predictive modeling within astrophysics.</p>

                <h2>Education Equity</h2>
                <p>Education is humanity's most powerful tool for progress, nurturing critical thinking, resilience, and the courage to dream big. It has the transformative ability to reshape lives and uplift entire generations. Yet, for many, high-quality education remains an elusive privilege rather than an accessible right. I believe that every child, regardless of background, deserves the opportunity to realize their dreams—dreams that hold the potential to shape a brighter future for us all. I aspire to encourage children facing hardships, showing them that their dreams are within reach. Through support and outreach, I aim to empower others to follow their passions, reinforcing that self-belief can overcome any barrier.</p>
